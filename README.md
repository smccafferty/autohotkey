# autohotkey
Collection of AutoHotkey scripts I have compiled to use for Windows to have a resemblance of development on OSX.

osx-hotkeys.ahk - This was used just to match some of the more common OSX shortcuts.
osx-vm.ahk - I compiled this script when I was attempting to use an OSX VM within Windows on a machine with 3 monitors. OSX VMs under Windows only support a single monitor, so I would fullscreen the VM on the main monitor then leverage Windows applications for documents, browsers, ect on the 2nd and 3rd monitors. The script allowed me to have similiar hotkeys across both "systems"
